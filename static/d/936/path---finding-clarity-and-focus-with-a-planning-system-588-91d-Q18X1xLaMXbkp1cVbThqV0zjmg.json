My focus shifted constantly. I had to be in the perfect environment, have one clearly defined task to focus on and force myself not to touch anything distracting. It annoyed me. And every few weeks, it happened again. Sometimes weeks would go by without being productive.</p>\n<p>Many times I searched for, found and tried ways to improve my focus. I tried todo lists, journaling, blocking websites, rewards, getting up early, working late, coffee, no coffee, music, no music, weed, noise canceling headphones, cafes, coworking spaces, working from home. The list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>These changes all had some effect. Some improved my focus for a day, some for a week, some made it worse (yes, weed), but generally — what worked one day, wouldn’t work the next.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While it’s obvious, it took me a long time to realise that as a maker, entrepreneur or independent worker, you have no manager. You need to manage yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Earlier this year I was talking to my friend Joris de Ruiter about these struggles. I explained how it caused me to feel busy all week. It caused me to work 10 hour days because I didn’t get done what I wanted to achieve. And because I was so annoyed at my inability to focus I wouldn’t notice and appreciate the things that I did get done.</p>\n<p>Joris walked to his room, came back with a notebook and said:</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“ I used to want to do so much in a week, that I was never able to finish everything which left me feeling unsatisfied. My psychologist then recommended me a system where I would divide the week into blocks, plan my week ahead and make sure I keep at least two blocks empty. This time I could spend on whatever comes up. Maybe this system works for you too. Look. ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2>On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much</h2>\n<p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad\nCommas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text\ndidn’t listen.
