I thought it would be fun to see where the people that buy my products are from. Those type of maps work well as social proof – showing potential customers that you are a trusted business and have served customers globally.</p>\n<p>It gives visitors a real feel of how many customers you have and where they are located. You could possibly add the order amount or the product bought as well, to give a better indication of which products are possible.</p>\n<p>I’m going to make this map for my SaaS product <a href=\"https://checkoutpage.co\">Checkout Page</a>. My customers are people who “connect” their Stripe account to my service. I have exported their data and turned it into a CSV file. This will be the starting point of this tutorial.</p>\n<h1>1. Get your customer/sales data as a CSV file</h1>\n<p>Most e-commerce platforms offer ways to export your sales or customer data. Often this export will be in the CSV format, which you can open in Google Sheets, Numbers (Mac OS) or Microsoft Excel. Here are some links that should help you to get your initial export for a couple of platforms:</p>\n<p>Shopify Orders - <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/export-orders\">https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/export-orders</a></p>\n<p>Shopify Customers - <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/import-export-customers\">https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/import-export-customers</a></p>\n<p>Etsy Orders - <a href=\"https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000343328-Downloading-a-Spreadsheet-of-Your-Sold-Transactions\">https://help.etsy.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000343328-Downloading-a-Spreadsheet-of-Your-Sold-Transactions</a></p>\n<p>Stripe - Stripe payments and customers exports don’t include Billing or Shipping addresses. It is however possible to get these via the API as JSON as explained here <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/list\">https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/list</a>. I use the following code to save my customers to a json file, which I then convert to a CSV file via <a href=\"https://konklone.io/json/\">https://konklone.io/json/</a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers?limit=9999 \\\n  -u [YOUR_API_KEY]: \\\n  -G\n  -o data.json</code></pre></div>\n<p>WooCommerce - <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/ordercustomer-csv-export/\">https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/ordercustomer-csv-export/</a>\nSquareSpace - <a href=\"https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206540677-Exporting-orders\">https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206540677-Exporting-orders</a>\nWix - <a href=\"https://support.wix.com/en/article/exporting-orders-in-wix-stores\">https://support.wix.com/en/article/exporting-orders-in-wix-stores</a>\nBigCommerce - <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Importing-Exporting-Orders\">https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Importing-Exporting-Orders</a></p>\n<p>Why not use this to create social proof and credibility, for yourself to get</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Create a map of your sales or customers with Mapbox","date":"January 04, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/create-a-map-of-your-sales-or-customers-with-mapbox/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/create-a-map-of-your-sales-or-customers-with-mapbox/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Create a map of your sales or customers with Mapbox"}},"next":null}}
