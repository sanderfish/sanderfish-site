At their little failures, accidents and annoyances. We laugh when they trip, drop something or bump into something. And when we laugh, we don’t do it to discredit them. <em>We really just</em> find it funny they did something by accident. That their body and mind did something different than they expected it to do.</p>\n<p>But oh does all hell break loose when this happens to us.</p>\n<p>So I wondered; if we can enjoy others foolishness, then why not enjoy our own? I’ve started making a point of laughing about my own foolishness. It’s actually very funny! I got stung by nettles. Funny! And over 30 mosquito bites. Haha!</p>\n<p>It lightens the mood. Not making fun of yourself. Just laugh. Don’t be so serious. Things go wrong, have always gone wrong and will always go wrong. Laugh about it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Laughing at your foolishness","date":"June 01, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/laughing-at-your-foolishness/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/laughing-at-your-foolishness/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Laughing at your foolishness"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518"]}
