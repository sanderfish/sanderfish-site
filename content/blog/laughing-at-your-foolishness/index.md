We laugh at other peoples foolishness. At their little failures, accidents and annoyances. We laugh when they trip, drop something or bump into something. And when we laugh at them, we don't do it intent to discredit them. We really just find it funny that they do something by accident. That their body and mind do something different than they expected it to do.

But oh does all hell breaks loose when this happens to us.

So I wondered; if we can enjoy others foolishness, then why not enjoy our own? Over the recent weeks I've made a point of laughing about my own foolishness. It's actually very funny! It's gotten warmer here in The Netherlands and as I've been working in the garden in the evening, I got stung by nettels Funny! And over 50 mosquito bites. Haha!

It lightens the mood. It's not my point to make fun of yourself. Just laugh. Don't be so serious. Things go wrong, have always gone wrong and will always go wrong. Laugh at it.
